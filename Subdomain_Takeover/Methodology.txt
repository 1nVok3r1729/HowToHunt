Step-1:- First of all collect all subdomain of the target using assetfinder,subfinder,chaos(needs API key).

Step-2:- Next sort out duplicate URLs using -- cat unresolved | sort -u | tee -a resolved

Step-3:- Pass it to subzy,subjack or other subdomain-takeover tool -- using subzy tool  --  subzy -targets resolved , or use subjack

Step-4:- We can also use nuclei templates but we need to first use httpx -- cat resolved | httpx | tee -a hosts

Step-5:- Next use nuclei-templates -- cat hosts | nuclei -t nuclei-templates/vulnerabilites -o nuclei.txt -v
